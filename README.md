# 📊 Youth Literacy Forecasting in Palestine (2024–2030)

This project applies **Facebook Prophet**, a time series forecasting model, to predict youth literacy rates (ages 15–24) in Palestine from **2024 to 2030**. It leverages real historical data from the **Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS)** and includes visualizations, interactive exploration, and GPT-style insights.

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Forecast literacy trends using machine learning.
- Compare predicted vs. actual trends.
- Auto-generate insights to explain shifts in data.
- Highlight how AI can aid humanitarian planning and policy.
